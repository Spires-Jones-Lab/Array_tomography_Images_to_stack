# Array_tomography_Images_to_stack

ImageJ macros to convert a serie of raw images into a stack (batch mode).

Choose the macro depending on the extension used (Leica .lif or Zeiss .czi and .zvi). 

Each .lif should contain a serie of images of the same stack. 

The name will be the same as the .lif file.

Just drag and drop the .ijm macro into ImageJ and press "run".
